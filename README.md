## 🧪 Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

### About This Project
This is a dashboard I built to explore bacteria found in people's belly buttons. The data comes from a study that looked at which microbes live in different navels. The dashboard lets you pick a person (sample ID) and see what microbes are found in their sample.

### What You Can Do
- Pick a sample ID from the dropdown menu
- See the top 10 most common bacteria (OTUs) for that person in a bar chart
- Explore all OTUs in a bubble chart
- View demographic info like age, gender, and location in a metadata box

---

### Tools I Used
- **JavaScript** (I’m still learning it!)
- **D3.js** for working with data
- **Plotly.js** for the charts
- **HTML + Bootstrap** for the layout
- **Git + GitHub** for version control and hosting

### Where the Data Comes From
The JSON file was provided in the course. It's hosted here:

```

```

Each person in the dataset has a unique ID, and each ID has info about their bacteria and personal metadata.

### Notes
This was my **first JavaScript project**, and I learned how to:
- Loop through JSON data
- Filter based on user input
- Build bar and bubble charts
- Connect dropdown menus to chart updates
- Use Plotly and D3 together
